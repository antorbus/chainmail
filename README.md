# LightLemur

**LightLemur** is a lightweight tensor differentiation library with minimal dependencies.

---

## **Installation**

Clone the repository and build the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antorbus/lightlemur.git
cd lightlemur
make
```

This will generate the shared library `liblightlemur.dylib` (or `.so` on Linux) in the project directory.

To run tests.c do 
```bash
make run-tests
```
or 
```bash
make run-tests-leak-check
```
to run tests.c with leak checks.

---

## **Usage**

### **Linking the Library**

Compile your program with the LightLemur library:

```bash
clang -o my_program my_program.c -L/path/to/lightlemur -llightlemur
```

### **Example: Basic Tensor Operations**
In python

```python
import lemur

x = lemur.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = lemur.tensor([4.0], requires_grad=True)

z = x + y  
w = z * x  
w = w.relu() 

w.backward() 
print(w)
```

In C 
```c
#include "../include/interface.h"

int main(){

    // t0 * t1 + t2 

    size_t shape[5] = {1,1,1,1,1};
    
    tensor *t0 = empty_tensor(shape, true);
    t0->k->array[0] = 2;

    tensor *t1 = empty_tensor(shape, true);
    t1->k->array[0] = 12.0;

    tensor *t2 = empty_tensor(shape, true);
    t2->k->array[0] = -15.0;

    tensor *t3 = mul(t0, t1, false);
    tensor *t4 = add(t3, t2, false);
    
    backward(t4); 

    print_tensor(t0);
    print_tensor(t1);
    print_tensor(t2);
    print_tensor(t4);

    free_tensor(t0);
    free_tensor(t1);
    free_tensor(t2);
    free_tensor(t3);
    free_tensor(t4);

    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
clang -o example example.c -L/path/to/lightlemur -llightlemur
./example
```
